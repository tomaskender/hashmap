# Hashmap library implementation in C
htab.h is the public interface of the library, which was provided to us as a part of a school assignment.  
Our task was to implement the library itself and use it in a wordcount application.  

# Tail implementation in C and C++
The second part of the project was to implement linux terminal tail functionality in both C (tail.c) and C++ (tail2.cc).
